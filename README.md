# Email Spam Classification Project

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project for classifying emails or SMS as spam or ham using the UCI Spam Dataset. The application includes data preprocessing, model training with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM, and deployment as a Flask web app on Heroku.

## ✨ Features
- Comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- NLP text preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal
- Multiple ML models trained and evaluated for optimal accuracy
- Interactive web interface for real-time spam predictions via Flask

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Flask
- **Dataset**: UCI ML Spam SMS/Email dataset from Kaggle
- **Deployment**: Heroku with PyCharm development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
